# ðŸŒ² Tree-ndk

Tree-ndk is a lightweight multi-architecture `tree`
binary for Android, installable as a Magisk Module. It is installed systemlessly, and is avalable in $PATH due to magisks overlayfs feature. It is accesable for use through adb shell and in android terminal emulators such as termux... (note: use in termux only becomes available once su is called and you are in a system shell.)
